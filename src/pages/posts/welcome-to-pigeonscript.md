description: Quick overview of the blog
---

Hi, I'm Joseph aka [TheWisePigeon](https://github.com/TheWIsePigeon), I made this blog because every programmer should have a blog, and also because I always wanted to share my knowledge with the world. I really hope that my content will be helpful to you. Talking about content, mine will be as educational as possible, but I will try to keep it simple and fun, expect me to use a lot of memes and illustrations to explain things. I will also try to write at least once a week. That's it, I just wanted to give a little overview of my blog in this post. Find some of my latest posts here:
